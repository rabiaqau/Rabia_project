The qualification task is focused on analyzing the Track Counting data from the 2018 emittance scans. Results obtained so far indicate a slight dependency on mu for the figure-of-merit of the emittance scans, but the quality of the emittance scan fits the track counting algorithm is also found to be poor. The first part of the task should focus on investigating the cause of the large chi2 values observed in the fits of the Track Counting data in the scan curves of the 2018 emittance scans and try to improve the quality of the fits. Subsequently, the mu-dependence of the results and the uncertainties on the calibration transfer should be studied. ultimately, an estimate should be targeted of the accuracy that can be achieved if the emittance scans were used to derive systematic uncertainties on the Track Counting mu dependence and the dependence on the position in the train. The results of the studies should be documented in the developing track counting internal note.
